# Setting up your Domain Name System (DNS) for {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}}
{:#set-up-your-dns-for-cis}

Read some specific instructions about how to configure your {{site.data.keyword.cis_full}} DNS records, including how to configure Secure DNS.
{: shortdesc}

## Secure DNS
{:#secure-dns}

**DNSSec** is a technology to digitally sign DNS data so you can be assured it is valid. To eliminate vulnerability from the internet, DNSSec must be deployed at each step in the lookup, from root zone to final domain name (for example, www.icann.org).

## Configuring and managing your secure DNS
{:#configuring-and-managing-your-secure-dns}

DNSSec adds a layer of authentication to the internet's DNS infrastructure, which otherwise is not secure. Secure DNS guarantees that visitors are directed to **your** web server when they type your domain name into a web browser. All you need to do is enable DNSSec in your DNS page from your IBM {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} account and add the DS record to your registrar.

You can select **View DS records** to open a dialog box that explains how to add the DS record to your registrar. You must copy parts of the DS record and paste them into your registrarâ€™s dashboard. Every registrar is different, and your registrar may only require you to enter information for some of the available fields.

## Adding DNS records
{:#adding-dns-records}

You can use the **Type** list menu to select the type of record you want to create. Each DNS record type has a Name and Time-To-Live (TTL) associated with it.

Whatever is entered into the Name field will have domain name appended to it unless domain name is manually appended in the field already (e.g. if `www` or `www.example.com` is typed into the field, the API will handle both as `www.example.com`). If the exact domain name is typed into the name field, then it won't be appended on itself (e.g. `example.com` will be handled as `example.com`). However, the list of DNS records will only show the names without the domain name being tacked on, so `www.example.com` is shown as `www` and `example.com` will be shown as `example.com`. The TTL will have a default value of `Automatic`, but can be changed by the user. A proxied DNS record will always have a TTL of `Automatic`, so a newly proxied record will change to this configuration during this change.

### A Type record
{:#a-type-record}

To add this record type, valid values must exist in the **Name** and **IPv4 Address** fields. A **TTL** also can be specified from the list menu, with a default value of `Automatic`.

   Required Fields: Name, IPv4 Address
   Optional Field: TTL (Default value is Automatic)

### AAAA Type record
{:#aaaa-type-record}

To add this record type, valid values must exist in the **Name** and **IPv6 Address** fields. A **TTL** also can be specified from the list menu, with the default value of `Automatic`.

   Required Fields: Name, IPv6 Address
   Optional Field: TTL (Default value is Automatic)

### CNAME Type record
{:#cname-type-record}

To add this record type, a valid value must exist in the **Name** field and a fully qualified domain name must be in the **Domain Name** (FQDN) field. A **TTL** also can be specified from the list menu, with the default value of `Automatic`.

   Required Fields: Name, Domain Name (for CNAME)
   Optional Field: TTL (Default value is Automatic)

Enterprise plans are able to CNAME another domain as long as that domain is configured within {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}}.
{:note}

```
Ex.
Configured CIS Domains:
  - example.com
  - different.com

test.example.com -CNAME-> test.different.com
```
{:pre}

The CNAME flattening feature is enabled by default, and cannot be turned off.
{:note}

{{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} does not support Cloudflare's CNAME setup. The only way to activate your domain in {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} is to delegate your NS Records management to {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}}.
{:important}

### MX Type record
{:#mx-type-record}

To add this record type, a valid value must exist in the **Name** field and a valid address must exist in the **Mail Server** field. A **TTL** also can be specified from the list menu, with the default value of `Automatic`.

   Required Fields: Name, Mail Server
   Optional Fields: TTL (Default value is Automatic), Priority (Default value is 1)

### LOC Type record
{:#loc-type-record}

To add this record type, a valid value must exist in the **Name** field. If you need more specific information, select the **Configure LOC options** button. A **TTL** also can be specified from the list menu, with the default value of `Automatic`.

![Create LOC Type record](images/dns/create-loc-type-record-1.png)

   Required Fields: Name
   Optional Fields: LOC options (click **Configure LOC options** to configure)

### CAA Type record
{:#caa-type-record}

To add this record type, valid values must exist in the **Name** and **Value** fields. The Value field will correlate to the value of the **Tag** list field, which defaults to "Send violation reports to URL". A **TTL** can also can be specified from the list, with the default value of `Automatic`.

   Required Fields: Name, Value (associated to tag)
   Optional Fields: TTL (Default value is Automatic), Tag (default is to send violation reports to URL)

### SRV Type record
{:#srv-type-record}

To add this record type, valid values must exist in the **Name**, **Service Name** and **Target** fields. Use the list menu to select a **protocol**, which defaults to the UDP protocol. Additionally, you can specify **Priority**, **Weight** and **Port**. These three fields default to a value of 1. A **TTL** also can be specified from the list menu, with the default value of `Automatic`.

   Required Fields: Name, Service Name, Target
   Optional Fields: TTL (Default value is Automatic), Protocol (Defaulted to UDP), Priority (Defaulted to 1), Weight (Defaulted to 1), Port (Defaulted to 1)

### SPF Type record

   Required Fields: Name, Content
   Optional Field: TTL (Default value is Automatic)

The first time you order a dedicated certificate Domain Control Validation (DCV) process occurs, which generates a corresponding TXT record. If you delete the TXT record, the DCV process happens again when you order another dedicated certificate. If you delete a dedicated certificate, the TXT record corresponding to the DCV process is not deleted.
{:note}

### NS Type record
{:#ns-type-record}

To add this record type, valid values must exist in the **Name** and **Name Server** fields. A **TTL** also can be specified from the list menu, with the default value of `Automatic`.

   Required Fields: Name, Name Server
   Optional Field: TTL (Default value is Automatic)

## Updating DNS records
{:#updating-dns-records}

In each record row, you can click the **Edit record** option from the menu, which will open a dialog box, which you can use to update the record.

![Edit DNS record](images/dns/edit-dns-record.png)

After you are finished making your changes, select **Update record** to save them, or **Cancel** to abort the changes.

## Deleting records
{:#deleting-dns-records}

In each record row, you can select the **Delete record** option from the menu, which opens a dialog box to confirm the delete process.

![Delete DNS record](images/dns/delete-record.png)

You can select the **Delete** button to confirm your delete action. Select **Cancel** if you don't want to delete.


## Import and export records
{:#import-export-records}

DNS records can be imported into and exported from {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}}. All files are imported and exported as .txt files in BIND format. Learn more about [BIND format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file){:external}.
Click the overflow menu and select import or export records.
![DNS Records Option](images/dns/import-export-records.png)

### Import records
{:#import-dns-records}

By default, a total of 3500 DNS records are allowed (imported and created on {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}}). You can import multiple files, one at a time, as long as the total number of records is under the max limit. After importing, you are shown a summary with the number of records successfully added and the number that failed, along with the reason why each record failed.

![Import DNS Records Summary](images/dns/import-records-summary.png)

### Export records
{:#export-dns-records}

Use `Export records` to create a backup of your zone file, or export it to use with another DNS provider. When this menu option is clicked, the records are downloaded to the location specified by your browser settings (typically the Downloads folder). To select another folder location, change your browser's settings to prompt you for a location with each download.
