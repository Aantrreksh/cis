 * **Domain Metrics**, which consists of Web Traffic, Performance, and Security tools
 * **DNS Metrics**, which consists of three traffic tools

**Notes:**

 * The smallest viewable increment for {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} Metrics is 6 hours.
 * Each chart displays only the top ten items. You can click on any item in the key to toggle the display of that item.

## Domain Metrics
{:#domain-metrics}
The **Domain Metrics** tools are a series of charts, tables, and graphs that show web traffic, performance, and security information.

**Domain Metrics** can retrieve up to 90 days at one time, but retrieving 3 different 30-day ranges is quicker.

* **Fewer Servers Needed** is shown as a percentage, which is a rough estimate of how much less capacity you need for handling your siteâ€™s traffic. It's based on the number of requests and bandwidth you've saved by using {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}}. It is intended to help you see how much less web traffic is going to your Origin server.

* **Bandwidth Saved** is a percentage that shows how much bandwidth you've saved by using {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}}. It is used in calculating the **Fewer Servers Needed** metric.

### Top queried DNS records
{:#dns-metrics-top-queried-dns-records}
This table contains a paginated list of the most-queried DNS records, in descending order. It shows the name and type of the record, and the number of queries received.

### Top DNS records returning NXDOMAIN
{:#dns-metrics-top-dns-records-returning-nxdomain}
This table contains a paginated list of the requests made to non-existent internet domains, in descending order. It shows the name and type of the record, and the number of queries received. If there are no NXDOMAIN responses, this chart is empty.
