# Machine learning models
{: #machine-learning-models}

Enterprise customers can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.

To enable auto-updates:

1. Log in to the CIS and select your account and domain.
1. Go to **Security > Bots**.
1. Select **Configure Bot Management**.
1. Enable auto-updates to the machine learning model.

Enabling auto-updates for the machine learning model upgrades you to the latest version immediately. You can toggle the button off within 24 hours to revert to the previous version. To make changes after 24 hours, contact support.
{: note}

## What has changed?
{: #what-changed}

If you are on an older machine learning model, you'll see a score change to requests scored by the machine learning source instantly. If you are already on the latest model, the changes show only after a new machine learning model becomes the global default.

You will be notified prior to a new machine learning model becoming the global default.

## Why you should upgrade
{: #why-upgrade}

By not updating to the latest version, you will be using a machine learning model that is no longer maintained or monitored by the engineering team. As internet traffic changes and new trends evolve, the scoring accuracy of older versions can degrade.
