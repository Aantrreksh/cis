# Firewall rule actions
{: #actions}

Actions are the mechanisms for responding to requests that match the criteria you define in a firewall rule.

The following table describes the actions you can assign to your rules, and are listed in the default evaluation sequence applied by Firewall Rules when looking for a match.
{:shortdesc}

| ------- | :--------- |
|_Log_|Logs matching requests on the CIS edge for access with Enterprise Logpush and Logpull. Recommended for testing rule effectiveness before committing to a more severe action. Available to Enterprise customers only.|
|_Allow_|Allows matching requests to access the site, as long as no other CIS Firewall features block the request (such as IP Firewall or Access Rules)|
|_Challenge (Captcha)_|Requires a user to pass a Google reCaptcha Challenge before proceeding. If successful, CIS accepts the matched request; otherwise, it is blocked.|
|_JS Challenge_|Requires a user to pass a CIS Javascript Challenge before proceeding. If successful, CIS accepts the matched request; otherwise, it is blocked.|
