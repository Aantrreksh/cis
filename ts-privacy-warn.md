# Why do I see a privacy warning?
{: #troubleshooting-cis-privacy-warning}

The certificates issued by {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} cover the root domain (`example.com`) and one level of subdomain (`*.example.com`).
{: shortdesc}

A privacy warning appears in your browser if your new certificate has not yet been issued.
{: tsSymptoms}

If youâ€™re trying to reach a second-level subdomain (`*.*.example.com`) a privacy warning appears in your browser, because these host names are not added to the SAN.
{: tsCauses}

Allow up to 15 minutes for one of our partner Certificates Authorities (CAs) to issue a new certificate.
{: tsResolve}
